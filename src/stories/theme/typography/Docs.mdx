<Title />
The Zeta type scale is built on a single equation. The formula for our scale was created to provide hierarchy for all types of experiences. The formula assumes
that the smallest size is 12px and increases based on the 4px mini unit, this includes line heights too (based on the baseline grid of 4px).

<Typography props={Type} />

REM typically assumes a 16px base size, so to work out the pixel value, multiply the REM value by 16px. For example, 1.5rem = 1.5 \* 16px = 24px.

## Customization

The fonts are defined as CSS variables in the :root selector. You can customize the fonts by changing the values of these variables.

```css
:root {
  --body-small: 300 1rem/1.25rem "Comic Sans MS", sans-serif;
}
```

By default, `<p>` elements use `--body-small` for their font, so you can change the font for all `<p>` elements by changing the value of `--body-small`. The same applies to other elements like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.

To change the typeface for all elements, you can use the `--type-family-regular` variable.

```css
:root {
  --type-family-regular: "Comic Sans MS", sans-serif;
}
```
