# Badges
<br/><br/>
## Status Label
<Canvas of={StatusLabel} />
To help some information, labels, or errors stand out, we present them with badges. They can look like buttons, but users canâ€™t select them. They just guide users to things they should pay attention to.

## Priority Pill
This badge is used to indicate the order of importance.

## Text Badge
Text badges notify users of line items that need attention.
